"I am surprised the East is still sending agents here. Especially after what happened to the last few!ú"
"<Abrahms whips out a gun from his jacket and sends a few shots careening off your shield.ú"
"This is a restricted area. Get out! Now!...ú"
"No matter. I have a much more full-proof method of your destruction. Pleasant dreams!ú"

"/Who's they?"
"<The dream givers. Their base is in the"

"<ordered the project terminated when"
"<they saw the direction he was taking"
"<it. Needless to say, Noah didn't"
"<like the idea. He felt he was on the"
"<verge of something big. He wasn't."
"<All he had was an idea, theoretically"
"<possible, but beyond his knowledge."
"<Richards and I are the ones who made"
"<it a reality. It's out of control!"
"<Abrahms is out of control! They both"
"<must be stopped. The brain is what"

"<Access the room. Lower the shield."
"<Use physical force. I can't tell you"
